# Tracked-Robot
Tracked Robot Project

This repository has been created to store all of the system level douments and conceptual work associated with my tracked vehicle project.
Any top level BoMs and drawings/models will be stored here.
Any sub-assemblies (PWAs and accociated software) will have their own dedicated repositories (will be referenced here)

Sketches and documents will be created using the LibreOffice tool suite
Drawings and 3d models will be created using FreeCAD
PWB/A documents are created using KiCAD
